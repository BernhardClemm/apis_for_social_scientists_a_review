# APIs for Social Scientists: A collaborative review
This repository contains the code underlying a review of APIs that can be useful to social scientists. Thereby it provides explanations, code examples and research examples.

You can find the document here: [APIs for social scientists:
A collaborative review](https://bookdown.org/paul/apis_for_social_scientists/). The introduction explains how this project came about.

### Why contribute?
* You can learn about an API by writing about it :bulb:
* You can help others to dive more quickly and more easily into the world of APIs.
* Your name will appear as one of the contributors and as the main author for the corresponding chapter.


### How to contribute?
* Provide feedback and let us know where you got stuck
* Correct errors and provide corresponding commits
* Write another review chapter of an API (contact us by [Email](mailto:apireviews.editors@gmail.com) beforehand please)
*     + To do so please check out examples of the other chapters for the structure, length and code examples (as simple as possible to get people started). (1) We will ask you to [send](mailto:apireviews.editors@gmail.com) a .rmd file with the API review of your choice. (2) Provide all references in bibtex format (see 'references_overall.bib') and include corresponding bibtex keys in your chapter (e.g., 'Dobbrick2021-iz').
* Add references to (your) published research examples that use the corresponding APIs
    + To do so please check out the examples in the chapters. (1) Provide a short sentence indicating how/for what the API was used. (2) Provide the reference in bibtex format (see 'references_overall.bib') and the bibtex key you used (e.g., 'Dobbrick2021-iz').
 
## How will we keep the reviews up to date?
* Descriptions of and code examples for APIs are only useful when they are up to date. Our plan is to update chapters that are outdated, e.g., if an API version changes. Sometimes this might require adding new authors/contributors to a chapter if the original authors become inactive.
